// include/strata/kernels/cpu/pool.hpp - P2.S3: the CPU expert pool.
//
// A layer runs TEN experts against ONE activation, and the expert kernel is DRAM-bound (Memory/LEDGER.md L9:
// 42.55 GB/s on 6 cores, tracking core count almost exactly).  So the pool's job is not to be clever - it is
// to keep every physical core reading expert bytes for the whole layer, and to be cheap enough that ten
// dispatches per layer cost less than one expert.
//
// WHY A FLAT BATCH AND NOT A RING.  P2.S3 describes a "lock-free SPMC ring", which is what you need when
// jobs arrive while others are still being computed.  Here they cannot: the host must SUM all ten outputs
// before the next layer starts, so a layer is a barrier by construction and the queue never holds more than
// one batch.  A ring would add a wrap-around to get wrong and buy nothing.  What is kept from the phase is
// the part that matters: `head`/`done` are single fetch_add counters, one claim per worker, no lock.
//
// THE PHASE PROTOCOL, because this is where a pool usually goes wrong.  One atomic word holds the phase's
// epoch, whether it is open, and how many workers are parked.  The host writes a phase's jobs while the
// previous phase is closed, then opens the next epoch; a worker joins with a compare-exchange on the whole
// word, so it can only join the phase it saw open.  The host closes a phase once `done == n` AND every
// worker that joined has parked again.  Waiting only for `done` is not enough: a worker can still be inside
// the drain loop after its last `done` increment, and the host resetting `head` underneath it would let it
// claim a job from the NEXT batch.  Closing is what makes a late worker harmless: one that notices a phase
// only after the host finished it (it was asleep, or descheduled) finds it closed and waits for the next.
//
// IDLE WORKERS SLEEP.  A parked worker spins for `kIdleSpin`, then blocks on the word (`std::atomic::wait`:
// WaitOnAddress, a futex) until the host opens a phase; the host wakes them only when one sleeps.  Generation
// opens phases every few hundred microseconds, and a round's longest gap (head, drafts, the first layer) is
// a few ms, so they sleep only between requests and while a prompt runs on the GPUs.
