// include/strata/core/prompt_cache.hpp - the --serve prompt cache.
//
// A request continues from the longest prefix of its prompt that the engine still holds, instead of processing
// the whole conversation again.  Three things hold prefixes:
//
//   * the LIVE sequence: the tokens whose cells the session state holds right now;
//   * CHECKPOINTS of the live sequence (session_ckpt_*): the fixed-size state at one position.  The K/V cells
//     are indexed by position, so restoring a checkpoint at `pos` and overwriting the cells from `pos` on
//     continues the sequence from there;
//   * STASHED sequences: a sequence the live one replaced, kept in host memory with its K/V cells and its
//     checkpoints, so a client that alternates between conversations (a chat and its title request, an agent
//     and its subagents) does not start over on every switch.
//
// Checkpoint buffers are a shared pool of `max_ckpts`; the least recently used one goes when it is full.  The
// stash's K/V copies share a byte budget in the same way.
