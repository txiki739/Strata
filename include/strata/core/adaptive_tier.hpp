// include/strata/core/adaptive_tier.hpp - plan v0.3 P6: a VRAM expert tier follows the conversation.
//
// Every few rounds the missing experts routed most often (decayed counts, at least twice) move into the tier: into
// their layer's empty slots first, then into the slots of the layer's least-routed residents when they were routed
// clearly more often.  The copies run on their own stream while the rounds go on; an evicted expert is a miss at once,
// a new one resident once its copy has landed (`apply_pending`).  Both decode loops (--serve and the speculative loop)
// use it, for the first GPU's cache and for a second GPU's.
